Why don't we use superclass?

Can't set severeal "block" args.
But it's looked good if
    Block ~
    Block ~
can be done
    => Let's make "block" method

Name a new class as |shape_func|
and write shape class like
    class shape(shape_func):

What will be appended are:
    * block method
    * blocks List


Let's move on"block" method
This aims to:
    * make blocks list from argunments


WAIT.I forgot each method is STATIC.
If I chagne blocks, all things that
already passed to builder might be changed.
